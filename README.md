The COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the magnitude and dispersion of racial wage disparities across US states

This paper estimates conditional wage gaps between black and white full-time workers. 
The estimation follows the approach of Kerr and Walsh (2014) and uses IPUMS’s population survey data for 2019 and 2022. 
The empirical analysis finds that the conditional wage gaps decreased in most states from 2019 to 2022. 
Thus, the impact of race on wages diminished during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, race remains a significant determinant of wages. 
Furthermore, the size of the racial wage gaps differs substantially across states.
